libogg-vorbis-android
=====================

This is a simple JNI wrapper for the libogg-vorbis library from Xiph.org.
It is set up to use the floating point instructions in an arm architecture,
and is plainly pointed at being used on Android. The intent of the wrapper
was to emulate a FileInputStream and FileOutputStream. Everybody knows how
to use them, and 95% of the time, this will do the job.

Anything that needs to be customized is done through the VorbisInfo class.
This class has defaults that work well for the Android environment.
